print(f"It's a story about a brave adventurer that some might even call....a Hero.")
print(f"Not just any adventurer or hero, but one of minute scale and enourmous hunger.")

cityName = input(
    f"Very well, {heroName} it is. Interesting choice, and from what city does {heroName} hail?: ")
print(
    f"Hmm....Well...As fate would have it, {heroName} from {cityName} is unaware that they are about to be sent on the most epic quest in the history of...quests.")

oxName = input("\nEvery hero needs their valiant steed, right? In this case your hero's steed is a 3,000 pound Dwarven Ox. What would you like to call your Oxen steed of glory?: ")

print(f"{princessName} certainly sounds like royalty to me. Very well, adventurer. Shall we begin? Who are we kidding, you've made it this far, of course you want to hear the story. Let's go. ")

# StoryBegins

print(
    f"Four score and seven...apologies, wrong story. We begin this story of {heroName} the Dwarf Paladin outside the city of {cityName}. You see, life as a dwarf wasn't always easy for {heroName}. ")
print(f"He was always the center of short jokes in the dwarven community, seeing as he had the misfortune of being a shorter than average dwarf. Though he was vertically challenged, he had a heart of gold and would do unspeakable things for food, as you'll soon discover.")
print(
    f"Often described as 'Strong, sturdy, and short. {heroName} was always looking for his next pint, and someone to smite.")

input(f"\nPress the enter key to continue... ")
print(f"As {heroName} and his valiant steed of glory, {oxName} were traveling down a winding road through the Valley of Forlorn Fairytales, not far from the city of {cityName}, {heroName} was stricken by an instatiable hunger.")
print("A hunger so intense that he heavily considered turning his 3,000 pound chariot of awesomeness into a feast worthy of Kings.")
print(f"{heroName} drew his battle ax and mentally prepared himself to carve his only friend into a hefty steak. Then, as he looked around to ensure no one was watching he noticed how far from {cityName} he had traveled and decided that we would rather deal with the hunger than to walk home.")
input(f"\nPress the enter key to continue... ")
# EnterCrow
print("Onward they pressed, farther into the Valley when suddenly a loud 'swooshing' sound was heard overhead.")
print(f"{heroName} ducked as a blue streak of light rocketed by his head.")
print(
    f"In shock, and quiet honestly confused, {heroName} looked around to see if he could identify the blue light or where it went.")
print("Just as he turned his head he noticed this absolutely hideous looking winged beast that appeared to be a crow perched on a log a short distance away.")
input(f"\nPress the enter key to continue... ")

print(
    f"In utter shock and disbelief that a creature could be so...visually repulsing, {heroName} opted to do this poor beast a favor and drew his bow with the intent of erasing this unsightly bird from existence.")
print("Just as he reached full draw a booming voice, as if from the heavens, thundered out of the beast's beak.")
print(f"'I am {crowName}, guardian of Princess {princessName}. It is my duty to inform you that the Princess has taken her leave from {cityName}, and is nowhere to be found.'")
print("'It is uncertain whether her leave was intentional or if she has befallen victim to foul play. Nevertheless, I seek your assistance in recovering her.'")

print(f"{heroName} stared deeply at this peculiar talking bird, and after a brief pause said 'No.' and grunted at {oxName} to continue down the road.")
print(f"As {heroName} and {oxName} began walking away the crow let out a sigh and said 'I don't have much to offer you, good Sir, but isn't the well-being of Princess {princessName} enough for your efforts?'")
print(f"To which{heroName} again, said 'No.'")
print(f"'Fine' said {crowName}. 'It is absolutely imperative that we find the Princess. What do you require as payment?'")
input(f"\nPress the enter key to continue... ")

print(f"Without hesitation {heroName} replied 'Listen, magical bird-man...thing. I am so hungry I almost ate me ox. If it wasn't a 15 mile walk back to {cityName} I'd be roasting this beefy bovine at this very moment. So unless you've got food, I'm not interested in ye games or ye Princess. Leave me be before I stick an arrow in ye. '")
